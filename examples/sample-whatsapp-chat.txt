[27/01/2026, 09:15:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Hey Jennifer! Thanks for connecting on LinkedIn. Saw you're VP of Sales at TechRetail - congrats on the promotion!
[27/01/2026, 09:23:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Thanks Marcus! Appreciate you reaching out. What can I help you with?
[27/01/2026, 09:25:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: I noticed TechRetail just raised Series B. You must be scaling the sales team pretty aggressively?
[27/01/2026, 09:27:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: You're not wrong! We're going from 12 to 40 sales reps by Q3. It's chaos right now 😅
[27/01/2026, 09:28:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: That's exciting! How are you planning to keep pipeline visibility with that kind of growth?
[27/01/2026, 09:30:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Honestly? That's our biggest headache. We're in Salesforce but reporting is a mess. Takes our ops team 2 days to pull accurate numbers
[27/01/2026, 09:32:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Ouch. 2 days is brutal when you're scaling that fast. What are you using for forecasting right now?
[27/01/2026, 09:33:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Mostly Excel exports from Salesforce 🤦‍♀️ Our CEO keeps asking for real-time dashboards but we don't have the bandwidth
[27/01/2026, 09:35:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: I hear this all the time! That's actually why I built DataFlow - real-time sales analytics that sits on top of your CRM
[27/01/2026, 09:37:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Interesting. How does it work? We tried Tableau but it was too complicated
[27/01/2026, 09:38:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: No-code setup. Connects to Salesforce in 5 minutes, auto-generates dashboards. Your reps don't change anything in their workflow
[27/01/2026, 09:40:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That sounds almost too easy 😄 What kind of analytics are we talking?
[27/01/2026, 09:42:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Real-time pipeline visibility, forecast accuracy, rep performance, deal velocity, win/loss analysis. All refreshed every 15 minutes
[27/01/2026, 09:43:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Forecast accuracy is huge for us. Our board wants weekly forecasts but we're off by 20-30% every quarter
[27/01/2026, 09:45:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Yeah, that's rough. Our customers typically improve forecast accuracy to within 5-10% in the first month
[27/01/2026, 09:47:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: How? What's different about your approach?
[27/01/2026, 09:48:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: We use AI to analyze historical close patterns, rep behavior, and deal signals. It learns what actually predicts closes vs what reps say
[27/01/2026, 09:50:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That would be a game-changer. What's the investment look like?
[27/01/2026, 09:52:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Depends on team size. For 40 reps, we're talking $3,500/month. That includes unlimited dashboards and our AI forecasting engine
[27/01/2026, 09:54:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That's actually less than I expected. We're paying $6K/month for tools that barely work
[27/01/2026, 09:56:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Yeah, most BI tools are built for data teams, not sales leaders. We built this specifically for VPs like you
[27/01/2026, 09:57:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: I like the sound of that. Can I see a demo? Preferably with someone from my team
[27/01/2026, 09:59:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Absolutely! Who should I include? And what's your calendar look like this week?
[27/01/2026, 10:01:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Let me loop in Raj, our Head of Sales Ops. He's the one drowning in Excel right now 😂
[27/01/2026, 10:03:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Perfect! What's Raj's email? I'll send a calendar invite
[27/01/2026, 10:04:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: raj.patel@techretail.com - He's usually free Thursday afternoons
[27/01/2026, 10:06:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Thursday 2pm PST work for both of you?
[27/01/2026, 10:07:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Let me check... yes! That works
[27/01/2026, 10:08:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Excellent! I'll send the invite in a few minutes. Should I prepare anything specific for the demo?
[27/01/2026, 10:10:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Can you show the forecast accuracy piece? And maybe how we'd track our 40 reps across different regions?
[27/01/2026, 10:12:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Absolutely. Do you have different products or deal types? Want to make sure I tailor it to your business
[27/01/2026, 10:14:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: We have 3 product tiers: Starter ($2K ACV), Professional ($12K ACV), Enterprise ($50K+ ACV). Enterprise deals take 6+ months
[27/01/2026, 10:16:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Got it. I'll show you how to track velocity by product tier and get early warning signals on Enterprise deals slipping
[27/01/2026, 10:17:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That would be incredibly helpful. Our Enterprise deals are so unpredictable right now
[27/01/2026, 10:19:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Yeah, long sales cycles are tough to forecast. Our AI picks up on engagement patterns that humans miss
[27/01/2026, 10:20:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Color me intrigued! See you Thursday
[27/01/2026, 10:21:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Looking forward to it! Just sent the calendar invite 📅
[27/01/2026, 10:23:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Got it! 👍
[27/01/2026, 14:45:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Quick question before Thursday - are you open to a 14-day trial after the demo? No credit card required
[27/01/2026, 14:47:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Depends on the demo 😊 But yes, we'd want to test it with real data before committing
[27/01/2026, 14:49:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Makes total sense. I'll walk you through the trial setup on Thursday. Takes about 10 minutes to connect everything
[27/01/2026, 14:50:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Perfect. One concern - how does this work with our data security policies? We handle customer payment info
[27/01/2026, 14:52:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Great question! We're SOC 2 Type II certified and GDPR compliant. We only read from Salesforce, never write. And all data is encrypted at rest
[27/01/2026, 14:54:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That's reassuring. Raj will definitely ask about that on Thursday
[27/01/2026, 14:55:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: I'll bring our security docs to share. Also have a few case studies from companies in your space
[27/01/2026, 14:57:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Even better! Looking forward to it
[27/01/2026, 14:58:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: TODO: Prepare security docs and case studies for Thursday demo
[28/01/2026, 09:30:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Morning Jennifer! Quick heads up - I'm working on something custom for Thursday's demo
[28/01/2026, 09:32:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Oh? What's that?
[28/01/2026, 09:34:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: I'm building a mock dashboard using your 3 product tiers and 40-rep structure. Will make it easier to visualize for your business
[28/01/2026, 09:36:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Wow, that's above and beyond! Most vendors just show generic demos
[28/01/2026, 09:37:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: I like to make it as real as possible. Helps you make faster decisions. Speaking of which - what's your buying process look like?
[28/01/2026, 09:39:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Good question. I have budget authority up to $50K annually. Anything above that needs CFO approval
[28/01/2026, 09:41:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Got it. At $3,500/month, that's $42K/year, so you can make the call?
[28/01/2026, 09:42:45] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Correct. As long as Raj signs off on the technical side and the trial goes well
[28/01/2026, 09:44:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Perfect. Typical trial is 14 days, but I can extend to 30 if you need more time with 40 reps
[28/01/2026, 09:46:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: 30 days would be ideal. We'd want to run it through a full month-end close cycle
[28/01/2026, 09:47:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Smart thinking. I'll set that up. When's your next board meeting?
[28/01/2026, 09:49:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Feb 20th. Why do you ask?
[28/01/2026, 09:50:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: If we start the trial right after Thursday's demo, you'd have 3+ weeks of data to show the board. Could be a nice win
[28/01/2026, 09:52:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: I like how you think 😄 That would actually be perfect timing
[28/01/2026, 09:54:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Great! So tentative plan: demo Thursday, trial starts Friday, you present to board Feb 20th with real results
[28/01/2026, 09:56:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Assuming the demo goes well and Raj is happy, yes that's the plan
[28/01/2026, 09:57:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Action item: Follow up after demo to kick off 30-day trial
[28/01/2026, 09:59:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Sounds good! See you Thursday at 2pm
[28/01/2026, 10:00:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Can't wait! This is going to be great 🚀
[28/01/2026, 15:30:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Hey Marcus, just had a thought - can your platform track SDR activity too? Or just AEs?
[28/01/2026, 15:32:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Great question! It tracks the full funnel - SDR meetings booked, AE pipeline created, closed-won deals. All in one view
[28/01/2026, 15:34:30] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: That's huge. We're also hiring 15 SDRs this quarter and have no visibility into their productivity
[28/01/2026, 15:36:00] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: Yeah, SDR → AE handoff is where most revenue leaks happen. We track meeting quality, SQL conversion, and time-to-close by SDR source
[28/01/2026, 15:38:15] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Okay now I'm really excited for Thursday 😊 This could solve like 5 problems at once
[28/01/2026, 15:39:45] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: That's the goal! I'll make sure to show the SDR analytics too
[28/01/2026, 15:41:00] Jennifer Wu - TechRetail: Perfect! Talk to you Thursday
[28/01/2026, 15:42:30] Marcus Chen - DataFlow Analytics: 👍 Talk soon!
