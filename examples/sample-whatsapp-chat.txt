[27/01/2026, 09:15:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Good morning David! Hope you had a great weekend 😊
[27/01/2026, 09:17:30] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Morning Lisa! Great weekend, thanks. Ready to kick off the Q1 marketing campaign?
[27/01/2026, 09:18:15] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Absolutely! I've finished the content calendar and ad creatives. Want me to send them over?
[27/01/2026, 09:19:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Yes please! Our CMO wants to review everything before we launch
[27/01/2026, 09:20:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: <Media omitted>
[27/01/2026, 09:20:15] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Just sent the PDF to your email. 15 LinkedIn posts, 8 blog articles, and 3 case study videos planned for Q1
[27/01/2026, 09:22:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: This looks fantastic! The case study videos are exactly what we need. When can we start filming?
[27/01/2026, 09:23:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: I've already reached out to 3 of your customers who agreed to participate. We can start filming next week if you approve the script
[27/01/2026, 09:24:45] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Perfect! Can you send me the customer list and script outlines?
[27/01/2026, 09:25:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: TODO: Send customer testimonial script outlines by EOD today
[27/01/2026, 09:26:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Will do! Also, I wanted to discuss the budget for the LinkedIn ad campaign
[27/01/2026, 09:27:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Sure, what are you thinking?
[27/01/2026, 09:28:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Based on your goal of 500 qualified leads this quarter, I'm recommending $12K/month for 3 months. That gives us enough budget to test multiple audiences
[27/01/2026, 09:29:45] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: That's higher than the $8K we discussed last month. Can you break down where the extra budget goes?
[27/01/2026, 09:31:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Of course! The $8K was for display ads only. The extra $4K covers:
[27/01/2026, 09:31:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: - LinkedIn InMail campaigns ($2K)
[27/01/2026, 09:31:45] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: - Retargeting campaigns ($1.5K)
[27/01/2026, 09:32:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: - A/B testing budget ($500)
[27/01/2026, 09:33:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Makes sense. Let me run this by our CFO. Can you send a formal proposal with projected ROI?
[27/01/2026, 09:34:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Absolutely! I'll have that ready by tomorrow morning. Should I include the case study production costs separately?
[27/01/2026, 09:35:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Yes, keep those separate. What are we looking at for video production?
[27/01/2026, 09:36:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: $3K per video, so $9K total for 3 case studies. That includes filming, editing, motion graphics, and distribution
[27/01/2026, 09:37:45] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Got it. Total investment would be $45K for the quarter then ($36K ads + $9K videos)
[27/01/2026, 09:38:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Correct! And based on your current conversion rates, we're projecting 500-600 qualified leads, which is about $75-90 per lead
[27/01/2026, 09:40:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: That's solid. Our sales team closes about 15% of qualified leads, so we're looking at 75-90 new customers
[27/01/2026, 09:41:15] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Exactly! With your ACV of $8K, that's $600K-720K in new revenue from a $45K investment
[27/01/2026, 09:42:30] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: The math definitely works. I'll present this to the CFO in our budget meeting Wednesday
[27/01/2026, 09:43:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Perfect! When should I expect to hear back?
[27/01/2026, 09:44:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Budget decisions usually take 3-5 days. Let's say by Friday EOD at the latest
[27/01/2026, 09:45:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Sounds good! I'll hold the Feb 3rd campaign launch date tentatively. If approved Friday, we're still on track
[27/01/2026, 09:46:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Actually, one more thing - can we add a performance bonus structure? Like if you exceed the 500 lead target?
[27/01/2026, 09:47:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: I love that idea! We can do a tiered structure: 500-600 leads = base fee, 600-700 = +10% bonus, 700+ = +20% bonus
[27/01/2026, 09:48:45] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: That's fair! It aligns our incentives. Include that in the proposal
[27/01/2026, 09:49:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Will do! So the updated proposal will include:
[27/01/2026, 09:49:45] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: 1. Q1 content calendar (LinkedIn, blog, videos)
[27/01/2026, 09:50:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: 2. Ad campaign budget breakdown ($12K/month)
[27/01/2026, 09:50:15] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: 3. Case study production costs ($9K total)
[27/01/2026, 09:50:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: 4. ROI projections (500-600 leads → $600K-720K revenue)
[27/01/2026, 09:50:45] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: 5. Performance bonus structure
[27/01/2026, 09:51:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Perfect! That covers everything we need for the budget approval
[27/01/2026, 09:52:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Action item: Send complete Q1 proposal with ROI projections by tomorrow 10am
[27/01/2026, 09:52:30] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Thanks Lisa! Really appreciate your thorough approach
[27/01/2026, 09:53:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Of course! That's what we're here for 🚀
[27/01/2026, 14:30:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Quick update - just sent the customer testimonial scripts to your email!
[27/01/2026, 14:32:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Got it! These look great. I'll review with the team and get back to you by tomorrow
[27/01/2026, 14:33:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Sounds good! Let me know if you want any changes
[27/01/2026, 16:45:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Hey Lisa, one of the customers (Acme Retail) wants to push their filming to next month. Family emergency
[27/01/2026, 16:46:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Oh no! Hope everything is okay. No problem at all - we can reschedule
[27/01/2026, 16:47:15] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Thanks for understanding. Do we have a backup customer we can film instead?
[27/01/2026, 16:48:30] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Yes! I have 2 other customers who were interested but didn't make the first cut. Let me reach out to them
[27/01/2026, 16:49:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Action item: Contact backup customers for case study filming availability
[27/01/2026, 16:50:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Great! Keep me posted. We really want to hit that Feb 15 launch date for the videos
[27/01/2026, 16:51:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Absolutely! I'll confirm the backup customer by Wednesday and we'll stay on schedule
[27/01/2026, 16:52:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: You're the best! Talk soon
[28/01/2026, 10:15:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Good morning David! The proposal is ready and in your inbox 📧
[28/01/2026, 10:17:30] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Just saw it! This is exactly what I needed. Forwarding to CFO now
[28/01/2026, 10:18:45] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Excellent! Also confirmed with MegaMart - they can film next Tuesday as replacement for Acme
[28/01/2026, 10:20:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Perfect timing! That keeps us on track for Feb 15 launch

[28/01/2026, 10:24:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: 👍
[28/01/2026, 15:00:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Quick update - CFO gave initial thumbs up! She wants one small change to payment terms
[28/01/2026, 15:02:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: That's great news! What change is she looking for?
[28/01/2026, 15:03:30] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Instead of monthly billing for the $12K, can we do 50% upfront and 50% at end of quarter?
[28/01/2026, 15:05:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Let me check with our finance team. That should be fine - we've done quarterly terms before
[28/01/2026, 15:06:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: TODO: Confirm quarterly payment terms with finance by tomorrow
[28/01/2026, 15:07:00] David Thompson - RetailTech Solutions: Thanks! If that works, we should be able to sign contracts by Friday
[28/01/2026, 15:08:00] Lisa Wong - CloudScale Digital: Amazing! I'll have the updated contract ready as soon as finance confirms
