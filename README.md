## 🎬 Video Story: What You'll Learn

This tutorial walks you through **Claude Skills** - a way to teach Claude reusable knowledge so you don't have to explain the same thing over and over.

### The Problem
Every time you want Claude to do something specific (like parse a WhatsApp export), you have to explain the format, the edge cases, and the expected output. That's tedious.

### The Solution: Skills
Define the knowledge **once** in a `skill.md` file, and Claude references it whenever needed.

### What We'll Build
A **WhatsApp Chat Analyzer** that:
1. **Parses** WhatsApp export files into structured JSON
2. **Summarizes** conversations with key topics and decisions  
3. **Extracts** action items, TODOs, and follow-ups

---

## 🧠 Core Concepts

### What Are Skills?

**Skills** are markdown files that teach Claude domain-specific knowledge. They follow a "progressive disclosure" pattern:

| Component | When Loaded | Purpose |
|-----------|-------------|---------|
| **Metadata** | Always | Name, description, trigger keywords |
| **Body** | On demand | Detailed instructions, step-by-step guide |
| **Resources** | Referenced | Scripts, templates, examples |

### Skills vs MCP vs Subagents

| Concept | What It Does | Analogy |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| **Skills** | Teaches Claude HOW to do something | A playbook or recipe |
| **MCP** | Connects Claude to external data/tools | A key to the library |
| **Subagents** | Spawns specialized workers for subtasks | A team of specialists |

**Key insight**: 
- MCP = **Access** (can I read this file?)
- Skills = **Knowledge** (how do I parse this format?)
- Subagents = **Orchestration** (who handles what part?)

> 💡 **Note**: This tutorial focuses on **Skills**. Subagents are typically implemented at the framework level (LangGraph, CrewAI) or through Claude's natural task decomposition. Skills provide the "playbooks" that any agent (main or sub) can use.

## 🧪 Testing the Skills

### Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code) installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- Or Claude Pro/Max subscription with Claude Code access

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/ShenSeanChen/launch-agent-skills.git
cd launch-agent-skills

# Open in Claude Code
claude .
```

### Sample Test Prompts

Try these prompts in Claude Code to test the skills:

#### 1. Test WhatsApp Parser Skill
```
Parse the WhatsApp chat in examples/sample-whatsapp-chat.txt
```

**Expected**: Claude reads the skill, parses the file, returns structured JSON with participants, message count, and messages array.

#### 2. Test Chat Summarizer Skill
```
Summarize the WhatsApp chat in examples/sample-whatsapp-chat.txt
```

**Expected**: Executive summary, key topics discussed, decisions made, participant stats.

#### 3. Test Action Extractor Skill
```
Extract all action items and TODOs from examples/sample-whatsapp-chat.txt
```

**Expected**: List of action items with assignees, deadlines, and priority levels.

#### 4. Test Skill Chaining
```
Parse the sample WhatsApp chat, summarize it, and extract all action items
```

**Expected**: Claude uses all 3 skills in sequence, providing comprehensive analysis.

#### 5. Test FastAPI Setup Skill
```
Use the fastapi-setup skill to create a new project structure for a REST API
```

**Expected**: Claude generates folder structure, main.py, config files following the skill's patterns.

#### 6. Test Supabase Setup Skill
```
Show me how to set up Supabase with pgvector for a RAG application
```

**Expected**: SQL initialization script, Python client code, environment variables.

### Sample Data Explanation

The `examples/sample-whatsapp-chat.txt` contains a **synthetic conversation** (no real data) between:
- **Alice Developer** - Frontend engineer
- **Bob Engineer** - Backend engineer  
- **Carol PM** - Project manager

The conversation includes:
- Sprint planning discussion
- Bug fix and PR workflow (PR #142)
- Feature planning meeting
- Decisions: FastAPI + Supabase for new microservice
- Multiple TODOs and action items
- Emojis, media placeholders, and multi-message threads

This gives you realistic patterns to test all skills without any privacy concerns.

## 📝 Skill File Anatomy

Every skill follows this structure:

```markdown
---
name: Skill Name
description: One-line description
triggers:
  - keyword1
  - keyword2
---

# Skill Title

## Purpose
What this skill accomplishes.

## Instructions
Step-by-step guide for Claude to follow.

## Example
Input/output examples.

## Edge Cases
How to handle unusual situations.

## Related Skills
Links to complementary skills.
```

### How Claude Discovers Skills

1. **Trigger keywords** in metadata match user query
2. **CLAUDE.md** project file tells Claude which skills exist
3. Claude loads the relevant skill body on demand
4. If multiple skills apply, Claude chains them

---

## 🎨 Visual Guide

_(Excalidraw diagrams to be added)_

### Diagram 1: Skills Progressive Disclosure
Shows how metadata → body → resources load progressively.

### Diagram 2: MCP vs Skills vs Subagents
Visual comparison of what each concept provides.

### Diagram 3: WhatsApp Analyzer Flow
User query → Parser Skill → Summarizer Skill → Action Extractor → Output

---

## 🛠 Creating Your Own Skills

### Step 1: Create the folder
```bash
mkdir -p skills/my-skill
touch skills/my-skill/skill.md
```

### Step 2: Write the skill
```markdown
---
name: My Custom Skill
description: Does something specific
triggers:
  - my trigger
  - related keyword
---

# My Custom Skill

## Purpose
Explain what this skill does.

## Instructions
1. First, do this
2. Then, do that
3. Finally, return this format

## Example
Input: ...
Output: ...
```

### Step 3: Update CLAUDE.md
Add your skill to the project instructions so Claude knows it exists.

### Best Practices

| Do | Don't |
|----|-------|
| Be specific about formats | Leave instructions vague |
| Include input/output examples | Assume Claude will figure it out |
| Handle edge cases explicitly | Ignore error scenarios |
| One skill = one capability | Cram everything into one skill |
